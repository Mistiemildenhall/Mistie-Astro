# About Me...

Astro Sky is a minimal, elegant, and streamlined portfolio theme built for Astro. Astro sky is generally designed and built for artists and designers, and seeks to find a balance between ticking all the standard boxes whilst keeping the code as simple and as intuitive as possible.

Specifically Astro Sky aims to:

- Achieve a perfect Chrome Lighthouse score for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
- Include fine tuned image optimisation.
- Accomodate for the use of svg images, both in the post content and also for featured images.
- Provide a general portfolio theme that looks nice.


Otherwise, Astro Sky is very much a work in progress, and currently I have a bunch of ideas that I would like to investigate to take Astro Sky further, including:

-   a mobile menu, so the main menu can accomadate more menu items.
-   a system to customise the social media menu.
-   a system to accomodate for different portfolio categories.

If you have any feedback or ideas, please keep me posted ([@henryegloff](https://twitter.com/henryegloff)).
