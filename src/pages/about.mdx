# About Me...

Heya! I'm Mistie Mildenhall, a creative soul with a passion for Graphic Design, Music, and all things Art and Design based in Byron Bay, Australia. With a background in music and traditional art, I have been greatly inspired by these two, combining them in my graphic designs through eye-catching dance posters, creating digital artworks that spark imagination, and crafting packaging that turns products into experiences.

As a Graphic Designer and music lover, I believe in the power of capturing emotion through art and sound to inspire connection and joy. My work is fueled by a love for bold, contrasting, maximalist feels, creating a lasting impression.
