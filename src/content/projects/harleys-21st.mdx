**Harley's 21st** 
===============

Harley's 21st poster was made for a 21st party/doof, this poster was inspired mainly from my past works from other posters and digital art I've done. I used a lot of 3D effects, contrasting colours and a slight informal layout with the text layout. I really wanted to convey what sort of music will be played there, resembling rave culture. 

*Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop were used to make this project.*
