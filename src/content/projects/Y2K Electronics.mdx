**Electronics!**
===============

Electronics was made through the inspiration of 90's/Y2k technology. In a design/art perspective these electronics can be such a statement even if put on thier own as I have done. The purpose of this design was to make track covers that would be shown on music streaming platforms such as spotify, soundcloud and apple music. I wanted to create a distict look to the series of track covers which would be in an EP or an album for an atist. I used a lot of pastel colours, fine lines and didn't add much detail into the overall design to enable them to be scaled down to a small size and to still be visable.
