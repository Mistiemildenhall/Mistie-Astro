Dance Now!
This project was created through the inspiration of the 90's rave scene and the posters made for these dance parties in that period. I have been very inspired by this period of time and what the rave scene projected towards art and culture. In my specifc design I used alot of bright contrasting colours, 3D/ bubble effects and informal layouts to produce a piece that gives a nostalgic but futuristic identity.
