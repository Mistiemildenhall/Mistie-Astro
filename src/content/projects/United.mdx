**United!**
===============

United was inspired by polyart and vinyl cover art. I created the face using an existing photo taken using a digital camera, and then used a wireframe of lots of triangles and then picked up the colour from the photo and dropped it in each individual triangle. This created a cool effect and worked perfect for a vinyl cover, creating a unique distict look that would be used to express the type of music. 

*Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop were used to make this project.*
