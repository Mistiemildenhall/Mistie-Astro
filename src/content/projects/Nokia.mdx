**Nokia!**
===============

Nokia was inspired by futuristic digital art. While sourcing inspiration I came across a lot of cyber/technology inspired art that gave off a furturistic identity. This is where I came up with using a Nokia as the main statement piece of the design, a lot of the design was not planned and more just chucked in as I was experimenting with the process and a lot of it worked in my own design perspective. I also loved the idea of adding in a message on the Nokia screen giving extra identity and fun to the design. I used a lot of bright contrasting colours, distict futuristic typfaces and 3D effects, all created in Adobe Illustrator.
