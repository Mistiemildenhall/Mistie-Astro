Dreamscopes!

Dreamscopes was inspired by 90's rave posters and the futuristic but nostalgic identity they project. The purpose of this design was to create a branding/ identity for a music and arts festival based in the 90's. I used a lot of contrasting colours, the well-known wire frame head that has been seen a lot through out dance music posters in past, and the distict 'BD Retrocentric' typeface. I used Adobe Illustrator for the all the graphics and layout and used Photoshop for the final mock-up.
